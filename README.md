# Simple OCR

This is a simple OCR web App, built using `Reactjs`, `Nextjs`, and `Tesseract.js`. It is a pure frontend App, without a backend, as all the text extraction is done using the webassembly version of tesseract library.

The accuracy of the results depends mainly on the quality of the image contents, e.g. if the image is generated by scanning a document using a digital scanner, then it's quality will be higher, suth the extracted text will be more accurate, while an image generated using a phone cam may not have the same quality, leading to less text accuracy.
